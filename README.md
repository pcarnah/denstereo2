# GDRN-Stereo
This repository contains code for Deep Stereo RGB-only Dense 6D Object Pose Estimation.
Leveraging stereo, we extend the state-of-the-art in the task of direct 6D pose regression.

# Paper
A paper is still in the works, in the mean time you can have a look at the master thesis https://github.com/janemrich/denstereo2/blob/denstereo/thesis.pdf.

Training and Testing
----------------
Please directly run ./gdrn_denstereo_modeling/main_gdrn.py for training and testing.

Important parameters include
>> config-file : the path to the configuration file.

>> resume: if 'True', continue the training process from the last checkpoint.

>> eval-only: if 'True', directly evalute the model.
